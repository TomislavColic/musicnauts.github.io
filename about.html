                    <p class="learning_txt">
                        Music, as an expressive art form, has deep roots in human history. Its origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations,
                        where primitive instruments and vocalizations were used to communicate, celebrate, and connect with the spiritual realm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="learning_txt">
                        The earliest forms of music can be found in prehistoric times, where early humans created rhythmic patterns using drums,
                        rocks, and their own bodies. These rhythmic expressions eventually evolved into
                        melodic sounds with the invention of simple wind and string instruments.
                    </p>

                        Throughout history, music has played a significant role in various cultures and societies.
                        In ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome,
                        music was closely intertwined with religious rituals, storytelling, and entertainment.
                        The Greeks, in particular, developed a sophisticated system of music theory that
                        influenced Western music for centuries to come.

                    <p class="learning_txt">
                        During the Middle Ages, music was predominantly associated with the church.
                        Gregorian chants and sacred polyphony became the dominant forms of musical expression,
                        serving as a way to praise and worship.
                    </p>

                        emphasizing clarity, balance, and formal structure.
                        This period laid the foundation for the symphony orchestra and the sonata form that still influences music today.
